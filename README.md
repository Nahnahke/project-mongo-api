Must-have requirements:

✅ The API should have at least 2 routes.

✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).

✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).

✅ The API should make use of Mongoose models to model the data and use these models to fetch data from the database.

✅ The API should be RESTful.
